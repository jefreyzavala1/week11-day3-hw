        <li>What is Express in Node.js and why is it used?express is a fast, unopinionated,minimalist web framework for node.js that is used for building web applications and APIs.Express allows quick and easy setup of a web server.</li>
        <li>How does Mongoose help in using MongoDB with Node.js?Mongoose manages relationships between data.Provides schema validation.Translates between objects in code and representation of those objects in MongoDB.</li>
        <li>Can you explain the role of Mongoose in managing relationships between data?Mongoose allows us to define schema for data models.Specifying data types,any validation rules.Moongose allows us to establish relationships between data by referencing documents from one collection in another by using the 'ref' property.Mongoose also provides middleware and hooks that allow us to define pre and post-save,and other actions to be performed on documents.</li>
        <li>What is a software design pattern? Give an example.a reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem in software design.It provides a template or guideline for structuring code and organizing components to achieve certain objectives,such as improving code readability, maintainability,scalability and reusability.MVC an architectural pattern used.The model represents the data, the view is the user interface, and the controller handles the logic and communication between the model and the view.</li>
        <li>Can you explain the MVC architecture in detail?it stands for model-view-controller.It's an architectural pattern used in software development.The model represents the data, the view is the user interface, and the controller handles the logic and communication between the model and the view.</li>
        <li>What roles do Model, View, and Controller play in the MVC architecture?The model represents the data, the view is the user interface, and the controller handles the logic and communication between the model and the view.</li>
        <li>Define Latency and Throughput in the context of APIs.Latency is the delay before a transfer of data begins following an instruction for its transfer, whereas Throughput is the amount of data moved successfully from one place to another in a given time period.In terms of APIs, minimizing latency and maximizing throughput are crucial for ensuring a smooth and fast user experience.</li>
        <li>Why is it important to minimize latency and maximize throughput in APIs? because it provides a smoother and fast user experience.When reducing the delay it takes for a request to travel from the client to the server and receive a response this results in quicker responses and faster interaction between the user and the application.Throughput refers to the amount of data that can be trasnferred over a network within a time period.By maximizing throughput, apis can handle more requests concurrently and process them quickly,leading to improved scalability and better performance.</li>
        <li>What is Authentication in terms of web development?is the process of verifying the identity of a user by obtaining some sort of credentials and using those credentials to verify the user'identity.If the credentials are valid, the authorization process starts.</li>
        <li>How does the authorization process start?User provides credentials such as username or password.Then application verifies the provided credentials against stored one.Next identity verification which is approved after user credentials have been validated.</li>
        <li>What is express.static used for in Express?is a built-in middleware function in Express.It is used to serve static files,such as images,CSS, and JavaScript, directly to the client.</li>
        <li>Can you give an example of serving static files using express.static.Yes for lab in order to serve up the CSS we first had to set up app.use(express.static('public')) in our app.js file.Next we placed a file called app.css inside of a folder called CSS that is a folder to public.So any public files must be found in the public and to acess on your browsing while serving running you can go to localhost:3000/css/app.css </li>
        <li>What is Jest and why is it used?jest is a popular testing framework for javascript that provides simple and intuitive API for writing tests.It comes with built in support for assertions,mocking,and code coverage.Supertest is an HTTP testing library for Node.js that allows you to test your API endpoints by sending HTTP requests and asserting the response.It provides an easy to use API for making requests and handling responses. </li>
        <li>How can Supertest be helpful when working with Jest?supertest enhances the capabilities of Jest by providing a specialized API for testing HTTP servers and APIs.It simplifies the process of writing integration tests,asserting responses and ensures the correctness and reability of your server.</li>
        <li>What is the difference between unit testing, integration testing, and end-to-end testing?unit testing focuses on testing individual 'units' of code, usually individual components,functions or methods.Integration focuses on set of components that are collaborating(interacting) to perform a task.End-to-end focuses on complete application running in an environment that mimics a real-world production environment.</li>
        <li>Can you provide examples of functional,regression,smoke and perfomance tests?</li>
        <li>What is meant by positive testing and negative testing in a functional testing context?positive testing refers to 'does it work when it is supposed to work' while negative 'does it fail when it is supposed to fail.</li>
        <li>How does load testing assess the behavior of software?by measuring performance metrics,evaluating scalability.It provides insights into how the software performs under ancipated loads and helps identify areas for improvement to ensure optimal perfomance and reliability.</li>
        <li>What aspects does usability testing assess in a software application?how intuitive(easy to use) is the software.</li>
        <li>Why is security testing crucial in a software development life cycle?because it test how secure the application is.</li>
        <li>Can you explain what compability testing is?how well does the software work with various hardware,O.S, network environments.</li>
        <li>What is the aim of recovery testing and why is important?how well does the system respond to hardware or software failures?Is it fault-tolerant.</li>
        <li>What is User Acceptance Testing(UAT) and who typically performs it?does the sofware do what the customers want it to do?Actual software user test the software to make sure it can handle required tasks in real world scenarios.</li>
        <li>Can you describe a scenario in which you would use each of the different testing types mentioned in the notes.</li>
